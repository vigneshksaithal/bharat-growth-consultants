We take our responsibility to dentists and their patients seriously so all of our Dental Telescopes provide the TRUE magnification that is expected.
Exclusive Telescope Design with Precision Coated Optics for the best possible vision through the lens and easy peripheral vision around the telescope, allowing you to switch from magnified to unmagnified viewing of the field without needing a third hand to remove or manipulate the telescopes.</description></item><item><title>Hygienists</title><link>http://vipatra.in/dental/hygienists/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 00:51:03 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://vipatra.in/dental/hygienists/</guid><description>NEW Micro2.5x ScopesTM True 2.5X Magnification Though some companies claim that magnification is not important, it is the most important feature of a magnification system. A system that magnifies the image only 2.0x reduces the users ability to visualize structures by a factor of 25%. Designs for Vision produces accurate precision magnification with maximum resolution.
Thru-the-Lens (TTL) Optics This lightweight system provides the Widest Field of View
Ergonomically Correct – Made for YOUR eyes ONLY Built to your Interpupillary Distance instead of one size fits all, these telescopes Incorporate your eyeglass prescription into both the carrier lens and the telescope.</description></item><item><title>Optics and Ergonomics</title><link>http://vipatra.in/dental/optics-and-ergonomics/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 00:50:30 +0530</pubDate><guid>http://vipatra.in/dental/optics-and-ergonomics/</guid><description>Designed and Manufactured Thru-the-Lens (TTL) Why Thru-the-Lens Magnification? Increases Field Size Reduces Weight Eliminates Hardware that causes telescopes to come out of alignment Why Designs for Vision’s Thru-the-Lens Magnification? Optically Aligned to YOUR Interpupillary Distance Measurement – ensures you are looking through the optical center of the telescopes, providing better vision
Unique Shape allows for better intraoral vision Exclusively designed, engineered and manufactured Easier Peripheral Vision and Better Ergonomics due to telescopes lower position relative to eye</description></item></channel></rss>
