      <description>True 2.5X Magnification Though some companies claim that magnification is not important, it is the most important feature of a magnification system. A system that magnifies the image only 2.0x reduces the users ability to visualize structures by a factor of 25%. Designs for Vision produces accurate precision magnification with maximum resolution.

Ergonomically Correct – Made for YOUR eyes ONLY Built to your Interpupillary Distance instead of one size fits all, these telescopes Incorporate your eyeglass prescription into both the carrier lens and the telescope.</description>

      <title>TRUE Magnification Matters!</title>

      <description>Designs for Vision has delivered TRUE Magnification since 1961 and we are accustomed to delivering the quality that is expected in dentistry. We believe that a 2.5X product should increase the image size 2.5 times. Though some companies claim that magnification is not important, it is the most important feature, enabling the dental professional to see better. A loupe that magnifies the image only 2.0x reduces the users ability to visualize structures by a factor of 25%.</description>
