##### True Magnification

The purpose of Dental Telescopes is to enhance or magnify an image to insure the highest quality results in dental procedures. We take our responsibility to dentists and their patients seriously so all of our Dental Telescopes provide the TRUE magnification that is expected.

##### Exclusive Telescope Design with Precision Coated Optics

for the best possible vision through the lens and easy peripheral vision around the telescope, allowing you to switch from magnified to unmagnified viewing of the field without needing a third hand to remove or manipulate the telescopes.

##### Custom Manufactured to Your Unique Measurements

including YOUR prescription, angle of declination and working distance, providing you with the best visual and ergonomic system available.
