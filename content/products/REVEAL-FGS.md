##### Designs for Vision introduces REVEALTM FGS, the first WEARABLE Fluorescence Guided Surgery system, providing surgeons with freedom of movement and positioning during FGS procedures.

Designs for Vision’s NEW REVEALTM FGS system combines blue excitation light with emission filtered eyewear providing vibrant fluorescent visualization. Various magnifications can be incorporated into the REVEALTM FGS system. This portable, wearable system offers the same visualization of other Fluorescence Guided Surgery approaches, with several distinct advantages including the ability to change perspective by simply changing your line of sight.
