### Designed and Manufactured Thru-the-Lens (TTL)

### Why Thru-the-Lens Magnification?

Increases Field Size

Reduces Weight

Eliminates Hardware that causes telescopes to come out of alignment

Optically Aligned to YOUR Interpupillary Distance Measurement –
ensures you are looking through the optical center of the telescopes,
providing better vision

Unique Shape allows for better intraoral vision

Exclusively designed, engineered and manufactured

Easier Peripheral Vision and Better Ergonomics due to telescopes
lower position relative to eye
