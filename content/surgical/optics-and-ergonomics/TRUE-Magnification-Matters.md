Designs for Vision has delivered TRUE Magnification since 1961 and we are accustomed to delivering the quality that is expected in dentistry. We believe that a 2.5X product should increase the image size 2.5 times. Though some companies claim that magnification is not important, it is the most important feature, enabling the dental professional to see better. A loupe that magnifies the image only 2.0x reduces the users ability to visualize structures by a factor of 25%. The purpose of Magnification is to enlarge the appearance of an object. Designs for Vision produces precision magnification with clarity.
